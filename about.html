            <h3>In the heart of the charming town of Maplewood, Williams Frozen Treats has a history as delightful as its confections. The story begins in 1924 with Michael Williams, a spirited entrepreneur
                with a passion for sweet creations.
            </h3>
            <h3>Michael’s love for desserts and his knack for creating unique flavors led him to open a small shop. His first creation, the “Frosted Delight”
                quickly became a local favorite, known for its rich, creamy texture and irresistible taste.
                Michaels’s modest shop soon became a hit, attracting customers from near and far with its delightful frozen treats.
            </h3>
